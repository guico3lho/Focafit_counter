  - `"-i"` to specify the input file (format: path, type: str)
  - `"-o"` to specify the output file (format: path, type: str)
  - `"-d"` to specify the date the counting will be made (format: "dd/mm/yyyy", type: str)
  - Run `python -m src.counter -i "./assets/input/chat_example.txt" -o "./assets/output" -d "15/05/2023"` to run an example of the Focafit_counter!
  - The result can be checked inside `./assets/output` folder
